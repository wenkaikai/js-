    <span>Dine now supports a "Let's not argue politics" feature so be on the look out for users who are not interested in having a political debate as a first date. It's better to save political debates for later stages of a relationship. So whether you voted Trump, Hillary or some other 3rd party that didn't stand a chance, it's time to set political differences apart. Get out, dine, date and take a break from politics.</span><img src="timg.jpg" />
